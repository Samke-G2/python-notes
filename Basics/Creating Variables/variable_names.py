# Python is a fantastic programming language for beginners and experts alike.

# It's the language of choice for many companies and popular pick for personal projects
# You can use it for automatig tasks, developing games, doing data analysis, machine learning, and much more.

# Let's say we work at a clothing store. We can use Python to automate a half-price discount calculation.

price = 239
half_price = price/2
print(half_price)

# With Python, we can store values amd label them.
#price = 239

# Labels like price are called VARIABLES. We use variables to store values, reuse them, and track how they change over time.
#price = 239
#half_price = price/2

# To help us understand what's in a variable, we pick descriptive names. If these names have more than one word we use _ 
# Connecting words with _ is called snake case. 

# To see the results of the calculation, we use the  print instruction. 
#print(half_price)
