# We've seen numbers, now let's take a look at storing text values here.
car_1 = "porsche"

# After creating and naming a variable, we use the = sign to store a value inside it.
city = "Miami"

# Storing a value inside a variable is like putting stuff inside a labeled box. 
# Here, the variable device_type stores the value "windows"
device_type = "windows"

# The values we've been storing, like "Miami" are strings. String values are text between double quotes.
# Strings can contain all sorts of letters and symbols, including spaces, like the value:
movie_quote = "Winter is coming!"
