# Lines of code are instructions for the computer to follow
# When we run code, we tell the computer to follow the instructionswe put together

# The order of the instructions matters because the computer follows the instructions line by line.

step_2 = "Run code"
step_3 = "Watch the fireworks"

# With the special instruction print(), we tell the computer to dispplay a value in an area called the console, also known as the shell.
print("Hello, World!")

# We can use the print() instruction as often as we want.
# The computer displays each value on a new line in the console.
